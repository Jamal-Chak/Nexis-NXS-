**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2026  
**Status:** DRAFT

---

## 1. Executive Summary
Nexis (NXS) is a Layer-1 blockchain designed for **sustainable business operations** rather than speculative trading. This paper outlines the economic rules ("Tokenomics") that ensure long-term viability for validators, developers, and enterprise users.

## 2. Tokenomics
### 2.1 Supply
- **Max Supply**: 21,000,000 NXS
- **Halving Interval**: Every 210,000 Blocks
- **Premine**: 0 NXS (Fair Launch)

### 2.2 Block Rewards
Validators are incentivized through a combination of:
1.  **Block Subsidy**: Starts at 50 NXS / block.
2.  **Transaction Fees**: Variable based on demand.

## 3. Fee Market
Nexis employs a **Dynamic Fee Model** to prevent spam and prioritize value.
- **Base Fee**: 0.01 NXS per transaction.
- **Congestion Multiplier**: If blocks are >80% full, fees scale by 1.5x - 5.0x.
- **Burn Mechanism**: Currently, all fees go to validators, but future upgrades may introduce a partial burn.

## 4. Treasury & Governance
- **Treasury Tax**: 10% of every block reward is routed to the Network Treasury (`NXS_TREASURY_POOL_V1`).
- **Use of Funds**:
    - Protocol Development
    - Ecosystem Grants
    - Emergency Security Operations

## 5. Enterprise Features
Nexis supports **Private Networks**:
- **Permissioned Validators**: Only allow-listed keys can mine.
- **Stable Fees**: Enterprises can configure fixed fee structures.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: KYC/AML rules can be enforced at the gateway level.
